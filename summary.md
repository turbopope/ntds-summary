# Strong And Weak Ties

A **Bridge** is an edge connecting $$u$$ and $$v$$ whose removal would cause $$u$$ and $$v$$ to lie in two different connected components.

An edge joining two nodes $$u$$ and $$v$$ in a graph is a **Local Bridge** if its endpoints $$u$$ and $$v$$ have no friends in common. The **Span of a Local Bridge** is the distance its endpoints would be from each other if the edge was deleted.

**Strong Ties** and **Weak Ties** are special edges. If two nodes have a common neighbor connected by strong ties they must at least be connected by a weak tie themselves. This is called the **Triadic Closure Property**.

The **Betweenness** of an edge is the number of shortest paths in which it is contained.
